					<h2>About me</h2>
					<span>
						I'm Emil (17), I live in Norway. My hobbies include playing/making games and making websites such as this. 
						When it comes to non important things like my hobby projects I would not be what you would consider a productive guy.
						I often get distracted by other things and often leave project half finished. 
						My project are for my own enjoyment (I like to have project to work on when I'm bored) 
						and to show friends and family if they are intrested. I am also always eager to help my friends with their projects.
						I love to learn and this is the main drive force behind most my projects.

					<span>
						I have from a yong age enjoyed video games and anything computer related. I used to tinker around with bash script just making small 
						terminal programs. I mostly did this to cure my boredom in school. Bash isn't the best language to make games or even programs for that matter, 
						but I just liked the fact I could just open notepad and start typing. I have also done a lot of Minecraft command block "programming" where
						I made cool datapacks for me and my friends. My first real programming language I learned where python, where I quickly got drawn towards
						game development. I have gone to school for IT but most of my programming skills comes from my freetime. I have made countless games
						on my freetime, most lost to time. I have a github repository where I try to gather all the games I can find in one central place. Most my games
						are written from the ground up where I make my own "game engine", but I also have some experience in unity.

						I have many things left I want to learn and do, so my todo list will never be empty. I have always something I can do.
						I can use days just fiksing a small physics bug in a game no one is ever going to play outsiside my closest friend group,
						but I don't care. The end goal isn't why I do it. I make games and websides because I enjoy the prosess of making them.
						I also have some friends that like to see what I am making so as a bonus I get to share my work with them.
